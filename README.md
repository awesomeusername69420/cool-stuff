I combined some repositories to avoid making too many in the future.

Things in here:
- givemeadmin (UAC spammer)
- kaboom (Window title changer)
- Malwarebytes Uninstaller
- Lightspeed Smart Agent Uninstaller
- Microsoft Edge Uninstaller
- UnRussian
- Krypt (Shows off some ciphers)
- DriveSlam (Uses up disk space, should've called it DriveFlood instead)
